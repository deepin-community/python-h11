Description: Pure-Python, bring-your-own-I/O implementation of HTTP/1.1 (Python 3)
 HTTP/1.1 library written from scratch in Python, heavily inspired by
 hyper-h2.
 .
 It's a "bring-your-own-I/O" library; h11 contains no IO code
 whatsoever. This means you can hook h11 up to your favorite network
 API, and that could be anything you want: synchronous, threaded,
 asynchronous, or your own implementation of RFC 6214 – h11 won’t
 judge you.
 .
 This is the Python 3 package.
